For Rooms:

== Section ==
Osc
- No timbre config. Pure wave.
- 3D directional controls
- Uniform volume
- Slow change over time rather than pure random
- Lights individual addressed. More palpable hue shifts between
--- brightness = volume; hue = note

Events:
- One octave per section
- One event per section (maybe 2)
- Distinct note times

=== Room ===
- Few room effects (maybe reverb)


===== EQ ====
- End of chain
- Presets
- Can we vizualize wave?
